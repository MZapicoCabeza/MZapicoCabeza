# María Zapico Cabeza - Data Science and Engineering Repository

Hello! I'm María Zapico Cabeza, a 3rd-year student in Data Science and Engineering at the UUniversidad de Oviedo. I have a passion for data analysis and data visualization as tools to understand the world around us and solve complex problems. In this repository, you'll find a sample of my projects and work related to data analysis.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R, SQL
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI
- **Networking:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Others:** MATLAB, Linux

## Experience

- I completed an internship at Accenture on a project that involved using causality techniques to solve a problem. I developed Python code to represent causal relationships in the form of graphs, as well as Pareto analysis and other causality techniques applied to time series data.

- I'm constantly learning about new data visualization techniques and tools, such as Tableau and Power BI.
- I'm looking for collaborators passionate about data analysis and visualization.
- I'd like help and feedback on optimizing search algorithms in my projects.
- You can ask me about causality techniques, data visualization, or anything related to data science.
- I speak Enghish and Spanish
- Pronouns: She/Her

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on a project! I look forward to connecting with people willing to work together and learn more about the exciting world of data science.

Thanks for visiting my repository. I hope you enjoy exploring my projects!
